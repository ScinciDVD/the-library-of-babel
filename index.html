                    <p>What is a man? A miserable little pile of secrets.<br><br>Sorry, I'm obligated to start every piece of writing ever with a question/reference. It's just in my nature. Awesome segue, that's what this site is about.<br>Not my many, many issues with the mass standardisation of the creative process (Ok, maybe partially that), but about<br><em>writing.</em><br><br>
                        Having said that, allow me to introduce myself to you. <b>I'm V.</b> The author here.<br>Well, <em>an</em> author. If you're reading this, you're probably in a similar position. In which case, I'll be happy to help in any way I'm able.<br>Not through any genuine advice or tips mind, just through giving you my experience.<br>Because notoriously, the creative process is a universal thing, that everyone goes through the exact same way.<br><br>
                        All jokes aside- I'm using this website as a way to get a few key things across to you.<br><br><b>1.</b> The creative experience is different for every single author, every single artist, every single person. No two creatives are the same.<br><br><b>2.</b> The neurodiverse experience of creative works is even different beyond that- and that's okay.<br><br><b>3.</b> Whatever you do, however you do it- That is perfect. So long as you are proud of yourself, nothing else about it matters.
                        <br><br>And finally, we arrive at chapter one. As I've blathered on about so much- The creative process.

                        <!-- p for paragraphs-->
                        <p>The journey from A to Z, as far as creative works are concerned, is anything but simple. And genuinely, I believe that's part of what makes creative work so inherently enjoyable for the creators. The problem solving.<br>
                        If you've ever written a story, there's a distinctly non-zero chance you've simply hit a wall during its realisation. You've been unsure of yourself, unsure of "Why am I writing this?" or "What purpose does this serve to my story?"
                        <br>And that's where your skills as a writer come in. Because chances are, the reader has the same question, consciously or not, and it's your duty to answer that, one way or another.
                        <br><br>You write to tell a story, to answer that question of "Why am I reading this?" One way or the other, you are trying to relay a set of information to the reader. You know that information beforehand, and unless you have good reason to believe they share your knowledge, you should treat the reader as if they don't.
                        <br>Now, the real kicker- <em>How do you teach them?</em>
                        <br><br>That's not rhetorical. That is up to you to figure out. And, if I may make a small addendum here, the emphasis on that last sentence is very much placed on <strong>"You".</strong>
                        <br>That's where each author's creative identity lies. How they share that information with the reader, how they impart what they know. For me, it comes in the form of metaphor, of symbolism (whether intentional or not), and of each character's very nature.
                        <br><br>If I may give some friendly advice- When you're planning your story, do what feels right for you. Yes, it sounds cliche, because it's true. For example- I plan my stories by making massive, colour coded word documents, detailing every little thing, what themes I want to explore with each character, the major events and how to get from one to the other.
                        <br><br>You are not the same. And that is amazing.</p>

                <h2>Chapter 2.<br>No Right Way</h2>      
                <!-- p for paragraphs-->
                <p>I want you to hold on to that last sentence of chapter 2 for a minute- Bear with me.<br>
                Every creator does things differently. And I'd like to say you'll figure it out just as simply as I did, but that's simply not true. Thanks to a fun thing called Neurodiversity.
                <br>Neurodiversity and creative work are linked almost intrinsically. For those who don't know- Neurodiversity is simply when your brain functions differently than a "Neurotypical" person. Put simply, not "normal".
                <br>My mother, for example, was an artist. Same with my father. Same with me- Though I've taken a slightly different route with the landscapes I paint.<br>The link between neurodiversity and creative work is no coincidence.<br><br>There is no "right" way to make creative works.<br>Every single work is different. Thus, there is no "normal".
                <br>Just you.
                <br><br>I think that's another beautiful thing about the subjectivity of creative works. No matter what you make, you're doing it right.<br>
                It may not be to absolutely everyone's taste, but you aren't creating these things because you think "Everyone else will really like this!", at least not for only that reason.<br>You are creating because you have an idea.<br>If 99.99% of the population doesn't like what you make, that still means about 820,000 people will like your work.</p>

                        <h2>Chapter 3.<br>There's a tree.</h2>      
                        <!-- p for paragraphs-->
                        <p>I'm very aware that I have a tendency to ramble, so, without further adieu- Here's some actual writing advice.
                            <br><br>Show. Don't tell.
                            <br><br>Nothing is more infuriating for me as a reader and writer than having information presented first and foremost through dialogue/just outright stating something.
                            <br>For example, if you want to show a character's cunning and ambition, rather than saying "He was cunning and ambitious", have the character demonstrate that, have them pickpocket someone and convince them it was someone else, have them <strong>demonstrate</strong> it rather than <strong>state</strong> it.
                            <br>There are few "rules" I keep to when writing, in most cases it feels like arbitrarily restricting myself just because I once heard someone say something.
                            <br>But this is genuinely a key rule. Showing the reader key information means more, it has more impact, it allows you to show off more if you want, and it shows you don't think the reader is stupid.
                        </p>    
                        <p>That one rule on its own will help bring your writing forward by miles. But wait, there's more.
                            <br>This part is- Less a rule, and more a guideline that will help a lot while you're creating.
                            <br>"Chekov's gun" is a term you might be familiar with- It's definitely one I'm all too familiar with. In simple terms, it just means that everything introduced has a purpose for being there- I paraphrase, but that's the general idea.
                            <br>I view chekov's gun as a tree of sorts. You, as a writer, need to decide if you want the reader to focus on a tree- A general idea, something they're familiar with that doesn't need more focus. If the thing you're introducing has no major significance beyond being set dressing, or simply being there for atmosphere, keep it to just the tree. Just tell them, "There's a tree."
                        </p>    
                        <p>But, if you want something seemingly innocuous to gain significance, if you want them to focus on a particular leaf of the tree or a particular element regarding the leaves, bring attention to that. Something like, "The tree drooped pathetically to one side, its leaves sagging, swaying gently in the stale wind." Immediately, that sets the reader's expectations, it goes from just a tree to now becoming this old, forgotten landmark in some desolate place. You don't need flowery language to set the scene for a reader, just to know how you want them to feel.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>As I said, the journey from A to Z for any creative, is far from simple.<br>And that's where the joy of creation lies for me.
                    <br><br>You need to find what makes creation enjoyable for you, above all else.<br>After all, how can you make something other people will enjoy if you can't even enjoy bringing it to existence?
                    <br>And, as I cannot reiterate enough, whatever it is about creation that draws you to it, the planning, the result, making the reader feel how you want them to-
                        <br>It will be different. It might not be what you expect. Typically, I hate planning things, and yet when it comes to my stories, it just comes to me so naturally.
                        <br><br>So try everything. And I do mean everything. It'll take a while. It might not even feel that rewarding. But once you find it, once you find that one thing that completes the process for you, you'll know.
                        <br>And that moment of realising you're at the finish line, when you didn't even know where it was before, that makes it all worth it.
                        <br><br>So, for my closing statement, I have one last bit of sagely wisdom.
                        <br><br>Your creations are an extension of yourself.<br>Love them as you would yourself.<br>They might not be perfect,<br>but neither are you.<br><br>And that's what makes you amazing.<br>You can learn.<br><br>Thanks for reading.
